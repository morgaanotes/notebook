# Lion to High Sierra

According to this thread you need to download El Capitan first
which seems to be possible from there https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886

If you still need OS X El Capitan, use this App Store [link](https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?ls=1&mt=12).
To download it, your Mac must be using macOS High Sierra or earlier.
